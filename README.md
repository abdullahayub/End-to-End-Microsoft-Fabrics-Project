**Child Pipeline 1: Dynamic Pipeline (Get Data from GitHub)**

Our Data source was on GitHub account, get the data from their and pushed into Fabrics Lake house by creating Dynamic Pipeline. 

Created Dynamic Data Pipeline, add three parameters for copying data activity, Relative URL (base URL), Destination (Sink_Folder_name And Sink_File_name).

Created git.Json file where the links of these (parameters) were stored in the form of dictionary.

Lookup Activity (FileNames), this will fetch all the URLâ€™s, all folder names and file names. Applied Foreach Loop (ForAllFiles) performed Copy Activity.
